Dequeue: 
   Deque or Double Ended Queue is a generalized version of Queue data structure 
   that allows insert and delete at both ends.
   
   	Deque can act as both Stack and Queue
	It is useful in many problems where we need to have a subset of all operations also like insert/remove at front and insert/remove at the end.
	It is typically implemented either using a doubly linked list or circular array

Applications:
1] a deque can be used as both stack & queue
2] maintaining history of action

DeQue in Java:
   Deque Interface present in java.util package is a subtype of the queue interface. 
   The Deque is related to the double-ended queue that supports adding or removing elements from either end of the data structure. 
   It can either be used as a queue(first-in-first-out/FIFO) or as a stack(last-in-first-out/LIFO).
   Deque is the acronym for double-ended queue.
