Binary Heap: 

used in heap-sort.
used to implement priority-queue.

Two types:
 1] Min Heap: Highest priority item is assigned to lowest value.
 2] Max Heap: Highest priority item is assigned to highest value.
 
Binary Heap: binary heap is a complete binary tree.

left(i) = 2*i+1
right(i) = 2*i+2

left(i) : means left child of i.
right(i): means right child of i.


parent(i) = [ (i-1)/2 ]

parent(i): means parent of i.


Min Heap: complete binary tree. 
          every node has value smaller than its descendants(childs).


PriorityQueue in JAva:
 in java PriorityQueue is internally implemented using Min-Heap. 
 if you want it in Max-Heap we can use Collections.reverseOrder() as follows: 
       
  PriorityQueue<Integer> pq  = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
