Tree intro:

node above : is parent
node below it: is child

degree: no of children it has
leaf nodes: nodes has zero degrees, has no children

Applications :
  to represent hierarchical data, eg, organization structure, folder structure, XML/HTML content, OOPs
  binary search tree
  binary heap
  B & B+ trees in DBMS
  spanning & shortest path trees in computer n/w
  parse trees

Variations of tree: 
   Trie
   suffix tree
   binary index tree
   segment tree
   
Binary Tree:
 every node has at-most 2 children, 
 
  
Tree Traversal:
1] Breadth First OR level order traversal
2] Depth First :  
             1. Inorder: left-root-right
             2. Preorder: root-left-right
             3. Postorder: left-right-root
