Graph: 
     non-linear DS.
     to represent random connections.
     
Directed Graph:  
    eg. a social n/w ie. if v1 is friend of v2 then v2 also friend of v1.
    sum of degrees = 2*E.
    


Undirected Graph:  
     eg. worldwide web, consider v1, v2 is a page. v1 has link to page v2 but v2 might not have link to page v1.
     
     sum of indegrees = E
     sum of outdegrees = E
     
Graph representations:
1] adjacency matrix
2] adjacency list

adjacency matrix & adjacency list comparison

                                    list                   matrix
memeory                             O(V+E)                 O(V*V)
check for edge from u to v          O(v)                   O(1) 
find adj. of u                      O(degree u)            O(v)
add an edge                         O(1)                   O(1)
remve an edge                       O(v)                   O(1)



Applications of BFS:
shortest path in an un-weighted graph
crawler in search engine.
peer to peer n/w
social n/w ing search
in garbage colletion
ford fulkerson algo
broadcasting.


Applications of DFS:

cycle detection
topological sorting
strongly connected components
solving maze & similar problems
path finding
